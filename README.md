## image-lambda

### How-to-use

- Upload .jpg image to hrc-img-bucket on AWS S3 app.
- Lambda function should automatically update the images.json file

### Issues

- I heard through the grapevine that some people were having issues with their images.json file path turning into a download instead of a link to a webpage.  At the time mine was still acting as expected but somewhere along the way, it started doing the same.
  - I'll have to check in with everyone else / TAs to figure out what's up.
- I also realized much later that I was a little unsure as to the scope of the assignment, so I'm not sure that I did what it was asking to do.
